- 👋 Hi, I’m @KobiKodes
- 👀 I’m interested in learning as much as possible. Nothing wrong with being a jack of all trades
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, R, Powershell, SQL 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that could possible help me learn. That's my main goal
- As I learn more and do more I will share it all for any collaborations.
